# Handle The Changes !

## Description

Handle The Changes is a *2-player versus game* (even if a single-player pratice mode is available). The goal is to make less mistakes than you opponent to win.

Difficulty and originality are based on the fact that the *rules are changing* during the game.

**Fit the changes and you'll win !**
